An assembler is a computer program that translates low-level assembly language code into machine code, which can be executed directly by a computer's processor. It serves as an intermediary between human-readable assembly language and the binary instructions understood by the computer. Assemblers enable programmers to write code using mnemonic instructions and symbolic labels, making it easier to understand and maintain the code. The assembler converts these instructions into the corresponding machine code representations, such as opcode and operands, which can then be executed by the computer. Assemblers play a vital role in the development of software and firmware for various computing systems, enabling efficient programming at the machine level.
